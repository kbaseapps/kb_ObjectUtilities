            The object types to count (e.g. KBaseGenomes.Genome, KBaseGenomeAnnotations.Assembly)

description : |
    <p>This method allows the user to get a tally of the number of objects of a certain type or types in the workspace.  This can be especially useful when the Data Panel fails to capture them, which may happen when the number of objects exceeds 10k.</p>
